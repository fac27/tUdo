# tUdo
Mark and Alphonso's to-do list project

## The aim of this project
tUdo is a personalised tasklist tracker. Tasks added are stored locally and progress can be tracked easily.

### Inspiration
Our main inspiration for the styling and basic functionality of tUdo was Notion, a versatile work planner.
